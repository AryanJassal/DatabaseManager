# Database Manager

## What is this?

This is a simple database managing web application made for my Year 10 Information and Software Technologies course. For a more detailed problem statement, view the [Problem.docx](https://github.com/AryanJassal/DatabaseManager/blob/master/Problem.docx) file.

This project is due on 16 December 2021. The project will only see active development until then or until the project is done, whichever comes first.

Project Status: FINISHED/TESTING

## Notes

- This project has been completed. Now, I need to test it out and confirm that it meets all the requirements. After that, the project status will change to `GRAVEYARD`.
- `Genres` and `Tags` option is present in the code, but it won't be used because `jquery chosen` is difficult to customise using css
